## About Switch Protocol

**Switch Protocol** is a Binance Hackathon project that explores how to make Web3 interactions more intuitive, meaningful, and accessible for real users.  
Rather than focusing only on on-chain transactions, Switch Protocol aims to highlight and route the value that emerges from user behavior, relationships, and participation within Web3 ecosystems.

The project is being designed as a **user-centric Web3 experience layer**, where complex blockchain concepts are abstracted away behind clear flows and friendly UX.  
Our goal is to help both new and experienced users interact with Web3 services in a way that feels natural, while still preserving the transparency and trust guarantees of blockchain.

For the full pitch narrative, detailed problem statement, and planned features, please refer to the slide deck:

### Project Goals

- **User-first Web3**: Design flows that make sense even to users who are new to wallets, networks, and on-chain transactions.
- **Abstraction of complexity**: Hide unnecessary protocol-level details behind simple, predictable actions.
- **Trust & transparency**: Keep core Web3 properties (verifiability, ownership, auditability) visible where they matter.
- **Hackathon-ready**: Focus on a clear demo story and realistic prototype that can be evaluated quickly by judges.

This repository acts as a **profile / meta repository** for the Switch Protocol project, giving judges and collaborators a high-level overview of what we are building.

### Binance Hackathon Repositories

This GitHub is used to manage the **Binance Hackathon source code** for Switch Protocol.  

- **frontend-web**: Web application for the Switch Protocol user experience, built with TypeScript.
- **backend**: Backend service that exposes APIs and orchestrates core business logic for Switch Protocol.
- **contract**: Smart contracts (Solidity) that power the on-chain logic of Switch Protocol.
- **ai-engine**: AI-related components that support intelligent features within the Switch Protocol ecosystem.

Each repository focuses on a specific part of the system, but all of them are designed and developed as part of the **Switch Protocol Binance Hackathon project**.
