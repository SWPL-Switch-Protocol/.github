## About Switch Protocol

**Switch Protocol** is a Binance Hackathon project that explores how to make Web3 interactions more intuitive, meaningful, and accessible for real users.  
Rather than focusing only on on-chain transactions, Switch Protocol aims to highlight and route the value that emerges from user behavior, relationships, and participation within Web3 ecosystems.

The project is being designed as a **user-centric Web3 experience layer**, where complex blockchain concepts are abstracted away behind clear flows and friendly UX.  
Our goal is to help both new and experienced users interact with Web3 services in a way that feels natural, while still preserving the transparency and trust guarantees of blockchain.

### Project Goals

- **User-first Web3**: Design flows that make sense even to users who are new to wallets, networks, and on-chain transactions.
- **Abstraction of complexity**: Hide unnecessary protocol-level details behind simple, predictable actions.
- **Trust & transparency**: Keep core Web3 properties (verifiability, ownership, auditability) visible where they matter.
- **Hackathon-ready**: Focus on a clear demo story and realistic prototype that can be evaluated quickly by judges.

This repository acts as a **profile / meta repository** for the Switch Protocol project, giving judges and collaborators a high-level overview of what we are building.
